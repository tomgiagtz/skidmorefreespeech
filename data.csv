Yes it's free speech but freedom of speech doesn't really let you say whatever you want. Constitutional interpretations by SCOTUS throughout the past several decades have clearly suggested that free speech comes with responsibility. If I want to say something wildly abnormal I am free to do so as far as the Constitution is concerned so long as I'm willing to accept the consequences of speaking out. Depending on the severity of your speech you might find yourself being silenced entirely within the confines of the law."
